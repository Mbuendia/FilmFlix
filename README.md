## FYI

I decided to use a small React, React-Router boilerplate because to get focus on the components and app design.

In this app you can see that techs used React, MobX, React-Router, MobX-Router, Cypress and Webpack. I've do my best with the few time that i have to this type of code test even i'll try to do some crypress test but i got an error that i can't debug (i can show you) although you can see with the cypress cli.
